# **Tetris Using Pentomino Blocks Instead**

## Description:
 This is a simple 5 x 15 tetris game that uses the 12 pentomino blocks instead of the 7 traditional tetris blocks.

## Controls:
* W: Turns the block by 90 degrees
* A: Moves the block to the left by 1 tile
* D: Moves the block to the right by 1 tile
* S: Slow Drop
* Space-Bar: Fast Drop

## Upcoming:
* High-Score Table
* A bot that can play the game by itself and tries to reach the best score
* Cleaner UI

## Current Bugs:
* Turning a block when it is touching other blocks may cause collision issues
* Fast dropping the blocks too quickly causes the user to automatically lose
